# curds — agent notes

This file is read by Claude Code (and `AGENTS.md`-aware tools) as
project-local context. Keep it short and load-bearing.

## What this repo is

A Go CLI + library for generating images via OpenAI's gpt-image-2 (direct),
plus images/videos via Replicate-hosted models such as Grok Imagine Video 1.5
and Seedance 2.0, plus background removal via Replicate's
`bria/remove-background` (segmentation), plus image upscaling via Replicate's
`nightmareai/real-esrgan` (super-resolution).
Module path: `github.com/gersham/curds`.

```

The library lives at the module root. The binary is in `cmd/curds`. There is
no `imagegen` package or `replicate-image-gen` directory — those were the
pre-rebrand names; the rename is complete and they should not return.

## Agent skill

`skill/` is a **standalone** agent skill (`SKILL.md` + `reference.md`) that
teaches a coding agent to drive the `curds` CLI mechanically. It is deliberately
self-contained — no `../.references/` includes — so anyone who installs curds
can install the skill by copying the directory (e.g. to `~/.claude/skills/curds`).
Agents installing curds should install this skill too, but **only if no `curds`
skill already exists** (don't clobber a marketplace-managed one). Keep `skill/`
in sync with the CLI flags and provider behaviour documented elsewhere in this
file; if you add a provider, model, or flag that changes the happy path, update
`skill/SKILL.md` (commands) and/or `skill/reference.md` (full parameter table).

## Conventions

- **Logs are logfmt.** Every event uses `curds.FormatLogLine(level, event, kv, color)`.
  Levels: `info`, `error`, `debug`. Verbose-only events use `logDebug` and
  require `Request.Verbose=true`. Don't `fmt.Fprintf` ad-hoc lines to stderr —
  it bypasses TTY-aware coloring.
- **Token handling:** `config.ResolveToken` is the single source of truth for
  the priority chain (`config > .env > env`). Don't read tokens directly from
  os.Getenv anywhere except `config/`.
- **Provider URL guards:** `isReplicateHost` parses the URL — never substring-
  match. Same idea for any future provider host check (an attacker can put
  `replicate.delivery` in a query string).
- **Verbose log redaction:** request bodies pass through `redactRequestBody`
  before logging so `openai_api_key` (BYO passthrough) never lands in stderr.
- **Aspect ratios** are mapped to multiples-of-16 sizes per gpt-image-2's
  rules. User-supplied `-size WxH` is rounded by `RoundSize`. If you expand
  the ratio map, the new entries must satisfy: both edges multiples of 16,
  edges ≤ 3840, ratio ≤ 3:1, total pixels in [655 360, 8 294 400].
- **Video support is Replicate-only for now.** `grok-imagine-video-1.5` maps
  to `xai/grok-imagine-video-1.5` and is the default video model when output is
  MP4 and no `-model` is supplied. `seedance-2` maps to
  `bytedance/seedance-2.0` and stays selectable. Both emit `Result.Videos` and
  save MP4 output.
  For Grok Imagine Video, exactly one `InputImages` entry is sent as `image`.
  For Seedance, one `InputImages` entry is sent as `image` (first frame);
  multiple `InputImages` entries are sent as `reference_images`.
  Keep model-specific video fields on `Request` and inside
  `ReplicateProvider`; don't add video HTTP calls to the CLI or TUI.
- **Default output path:** `<config.output.directory>/<unix_milli>.<format>`.
  Changing the default path → update `config.DefaultTOML` and the README.
- **No emojis, no chatty trailing summaries** in user-facing CLI output. Logs
  are the audit trail; stdout is just the saved file path(s).
- **One canonical name per flag.** No `-p`/`-prompt` aliases. Long forms
  only — they're self-documenting and play better with LLM tool-use.
- **TUI is bubbletea.** `tui.RunInteractive` owns the main loop (banner,
  prompt, generating, result, generate-another). The CLI passes a
  `GenerateFn` callback that builds a `curds.Request` and runs it; logs
  flow through an `io.Writer` so the TUI's panel and the CLI's stderr
  see the same logfmt events.

## Build & test

```bash
go build -o curds ./cmd/curds
go test ./...
./install.sh
```

`go test ./...` should pass before any commit. The httptest-based provider
tests are deterministic and fast.

## Adding a provider

1. New file `<name>.go` in the root (`package curds`) implementing
   `Provider` (`Generate`, `Name`).
2. Wire it in `Client.providerFor` and `New()`.
3. Add a `ProviderXXX` constant + default model.
4. If it has different aspect-ratio constraints, gate them in `Request.Validate`.
5. Cover the happy path, an error response, and any polling/edit flow with
   httptest in `curds_test.go`.

## Adding a model

`config.toml`:

```toml
[models.<key>]
openai_name = "..."
replicate_name = "..."
```

The CLI's `-model <key>` looks the value up via `config.ResolveModel`.

## Things to avoid

- Don't add a `replicate-image-gen` or `imagegen` directory — the rebrand is
  intentional and complete.
- Don't reach into `os.Getenv` for `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`
  outside of `config/` — it breaks the priority chain.
- Don't write to the user's `~/.config/curds/config.toml` except via
  `config.SaveTokens` (called only by the TUI when the user opted in).
- Don't add network calls outside the providers — the CLI should never talk
  HTTP directly. Same for the TUI.

## Files outside the repo curds touches

- `~/.config/curds/config.toml` — auto-created on first run
- `~/Desktop/curds/<ms>.<format>` — default output dir, auto-created
- `.env` in cwd — read-only, optional
